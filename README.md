**This mod requires MCM to run.**

Increase implant slot per body part.

**Need to restart the game after MCM config setup for this mod to take effect. On existing save, existing clone with unupdated implant count must have new augment installed to have implant count updated.**

i.e you need to have arm/leg/joint AUGMENT installed to see those count updated.

While it will not increase enemy's implant count, enemies who can spawn with more than 1 implant may spawn with duplicates.


Changelog:

v1.2:
Fixed issue where "ignore injury" did not apply to aug due to a typo.

v1.1:
Now adds an option to
1. "Ignore implant type limitation" option to body part. (i.e can't implant quasi augment into mechanical body part. now you can.)
2. "Ignore Augment\Implant damage from Injury". Health screen will suggest that those are disabled but the raw stat bonus and active implants will continue to function.
